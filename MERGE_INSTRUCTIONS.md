# Merge the Railway deployment fixes

To review and merge the outstanding Railway deployment updates, use GitHub’s
compare view with the branch that actually exists on the remote repository:

```
https://github.com/stevewinfieldtx/TotalChat/compare/main...work?expand=1
```

That URL opens a diff between `main` and the `work` branch that contains these
changes. From there you can press **Create pull request**, double-check the
changes, and click **Merge**.

If your default branch uses a different name (for example `master`), update the
`main` segment of the link before visiting it. If you see “There isn’t anything
to compare,” double-check the branch name for typos or confirm that you’re using
the exact `work` reference shown above.
