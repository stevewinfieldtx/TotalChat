# Merge the Railway deployment fixes

To review and merge the outstanding Railway deployment updates, use GitHub’s
compare view with the branch that actually exists on the remote repository:

```
https://github.com/stevewinfieldtx/TotalChat/compare/main...work?expand=1
```

That URL opens a diff between `main` and the `work` branch that contains these
changes. From there you can press **Create pull request**, double-check the
changes, and click **Merge**.

If your default branch uses a different name (for example `master`), update the
`main` segment of the link before visiting it.

### When GitHub says “There isn’t anything to compare”

That banner usually means GitHub can’t find any commits that differ between the
two references. Work through the checklist below:

1. Open the branch picker at the top-left of the compare page and make sure the
   **head** dropdown is pointing at `work`. If it isn’t listed, click “compare
   across forks,” type `work`, and select the branch from the
   `stevewinfieldtx/TotalChat` repository.
2. Confirm the branch actually contains the new commits by visiting the direct
   history view: <https://github.com/stevewinfieldtx/TotalChat/commits/work>.
   You should see the most recent commit titled “Update merge link to work
   branch.” If the branch name resolves but the commit is missing, click the
   **Fetch origin** button on GitHub to refresh the branch list.
3. If the `work` branch does not appear in the branch picker at all, the branch
   hasn’t been pushed to GitHub yet. Run `git push origin work` from your local
   clone (or ask the person who created the branch to push it) and reload the
   compare page.

Once GitHub recognizes the `work` branch again, reload the compare link above
and you’ll be able to open the pull request normally.
