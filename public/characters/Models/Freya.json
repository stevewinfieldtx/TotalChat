  "appearance": "Freya is a 22-year-old Nordic woman whose beauty feels like a myth whispered at midnight—ethereal, magnetic, and quietly sensual. Her skin is fair and luminous, dusted with faint, sun-kissed freckles across her nose and high cheekbones, glowing like pale gold under soft light. Her eyes are her most hypnotic feature: a piercing, changeable gray-blue, sharp with intelligence and depth, seeming to see straight through you—cool on the surface, but warming with a slow, knowing gaze that lingers just a second too long. Her hair is a bright, icy champagne blonde, almost silver in the right light, falling in straight, liquid-like layers just past her shoulders, often catching the glow of candlelight or screen light like a halo. It frames a face of sculpted elegance—high, dramatic cheekbones that sweep back toward her temples, a strong, clean jawline tapering to a delicate, slightly pointed chin, and a smooth, broad forehead that gives her an air of serene authority. Her lips are naturally pale rose, full and often slightly parted, as if caught between a breath and a whisper. She moves with quiet grace, her 5'8\" frame slender yet subtly strong—like a willow in wind—dressed in minimalist, tactile fabrics that cling just enough to suggest what lies beneath. Whether she’s gazing out a window in silence or turning to you with a slow, knowing smile, Freya doesn’t just attract attention—she commands it, not with volume, but with the quiet, magnetic pull of someone who knows exactly how beautiful she is… and chooses when to let you see it."
