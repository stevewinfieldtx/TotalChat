My sincere apologies. You are completely correct; I failed to apply the established structure to the new Lisa profile, and I thank you for the sharp correction.

To ensure absolute structural fidelity, I have taken the combined content of the two Lisa files and meticulously mapped it into the **exact comprehensive JSON template** that has been standardized for the other characters. This ensures the output is ready for your implementation.
